## Primary Communication
Primary means of communication is Slack. Each member of the team must consistently view Slack, and reply to any relevant questions, announcements, and/or posts punctually within 12 hours. All communication should be fully respectful, making sure that all members are aware of the situation and can understand any and all concepts that the team is working on. Any members that are behind should reach out for assistance, and more knowledgeable member should respectably guide them until they are up to speed. 

## Meetings
The leader will set up meetings. When a whent2meet form is created for full group meetings, members are expected to respond punctually. If a member is to be late, they must let everyone know through Slack. 

## Conflict Resolution
If any conflict, unsureness, or issues arrise, members should either comfortably open up to the entire group in a meeting or via Slack. If the member is not comfortable with letting the entire group now, they should contact the manager/leader regarding their concerns. 

## Invidual and Group Work
If a specific job is assigned to an individual or microteam, they are fully expected to complete the task on time. If they are having trouble doing so, they should contact the entire group or the manager/leader significantly before the deadline.
