# For Developers:

## Process to make code changes:
### Manually do the following:
- Create a branch feat/<feat-name>  (for feature) or fix/<fix-name> (for fix).
- Do the development locally (on this new branch) as you would.
- Keep committing and pushing to this branch.
- Once feature is complete or bug fix is done, create a PR to main branch.
### The github action (test.yml) will automatically run tests (wait for test to pass) lint.yml will check styling and doc.yml will generate documentation
### Manually:
- Click merge in the pull request
- You might want to have a code review (the reviewer does the merge finally)

#### Repeat this process to make any edits moving forward
