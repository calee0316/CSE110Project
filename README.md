# For Developers:

## Process to make code changes:
### Manually do the following:
- change what you want with the code locally.
- create a new branch on GitHub called dev
- push your changes to the dev branch
- create a pull request from dev to main
### The yml files will automatically run tests
- wait for the tests to finish, make sure there are no errors
### Manually:
- Click merge in the pull request
- if the merge is successful, delete the dev branch that you had created.
- the delete is to ensure we do not have older copies lying around as a merge conflict risk.

#### Repeat this process to make any edits moving forward
