# Decision Made: Position On the Team

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Everyone on the development team
* Date: 2021-02-19

## Context and Problem Statement

What will our page look like and sound like? 

## Decision Drivers 

* Need page to be simple and not distracting
* Want to keep our theme of Mario 
* Want a way to keep track of time besides just a countdown Timer
* Make it possible for different languages

## Considered Options

1. Completely minimalistic design, no theme. 
2. More mario theme, lots of color
3. Middle ground, black and white mario theme and background, only mushroom has color. 

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Went with a simple black and white based page, but also mario themed. The background is black and white mario stage. Mushroom changes color based on state.
Language can be changed based on user preference. Countdown timer as well as circle count animation. Mario themed sounds are played on state changes.

## Pros and Cons of the Options 

### Pros

* Allows users who speak different languages. 
* Minimalistic yet themed and playful design 
* easy to keep track of time using countdown timer, circle animation, and sounds
* mario theme and rewarding stars and "stage completions" keeps user motivated.

### Cons
* Possibly more distracting design compared to a completely 100% minimalistic approach with no theme. 
* Currently not a chrome extensions, must take up an entire browser tab/window.
