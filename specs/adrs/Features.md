# Decision Made: Features vs Testing

* Status: Accepted
* Deciders: Everyone on the development team
* Date: 2021-02-23 (China/Korea Time)

## Context and Problem Statement

Testing is really buggy right now, not sure if we want to go ahead with ToDo List features. 

## Decision Drivers 

* Right now bus factor is too low 
* DOM Testing is creating a lot of issue with circle animation 
* Implementing ToDo List might break the program 
* Trying to make our product competitive 
* Midterms/Finals are coming up 

## Considered Options

1. We scrapped the ToDoList and put focus on DOM Testing and if time premits, we work on ToDo List, there might be a chance we will not finish the testing 
2. We put back DOM Testing and focus on improving the ToDo List for better UI experience 
3. We run both DOM Testing and ToDolist at the same time and rotate minds to get new eyes and reset mentals
## Decision Outcome

Chose option: Went with number 3 so we have more time to fix both aspects given our time constraints

### Positive Consequences 

* Allows people to switch to work on different things which will hopefully increase productivity 
* More time allocated for debugging and asking for help
* Improves UI experience and makes us more competitive 

### Negative Consequences 

* Less people working on one thing, might reduce efficency 

## Pros and Cons of the Options 

### Scraped the ToDoList, Focus on DOM Testing 

* Good, better testing which will imrpove test coverage
* Bad, our UI will be less appealing
* Bad, if we were able to fix testing, might not have enough time to implement ToDo List 

### Do the ToDo List and less prioritize on DOM Testing

* Good, better UI expereince and makes our product more compelling
* Bad, Test coverage might not be 100% 
* Bad, not testing can cause issues with program, in fact, there might be a chance that the project could crash 

### Parallel Project where ToDo List and DOM Testing are both worked on at the same time

* Good, UI experience is more appealing since we are doing ToDo List
* Good, Started working on testing early allows more time to get help from TA if issues arise 
* Bad, Labor work is spread thin for this parallel project
